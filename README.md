# Lua Language Addon Manager

Basic addon (package) manager for LuaLS addons. Includes ability to add, remove, update, and clean addons from [`LuaCATS`](https://github.com/LuaCATS) and from any `github` repository. Eventually it will also include helpers and commands for setting settings and configuration options inside of the `.luarc.json`.
